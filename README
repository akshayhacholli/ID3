Details about the project
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| # The following program is written in JAVA.                                                                  |
| # The program builds a Decision Tree using ID3 algorithm.                                                    |
| # It takes two inputs as command line arguments.                                                             |
| 	- First one is the "Training" file using which tree will be built.                                         |
| 	- Second one is the "Testing" used to test the accuracy of decision tree.                                  |
| # The entire program uses four java files namely - Attribute.java, ID3.java, TreeData.java, TrainData.java.  |
| # The main program resides in the file ID3.java and that's the starting point of program.                    |

 *  Operating system : Tested on windows and ubuntu machine
 *  Assumption : Java path is set
 *
 *  Compilation : javac -d . directory_path\ID3\*.java
 *  Execution: java ID3/ID3 "path_of_train_file" "path_of_test_file"
 *  
 *  Input : file path of train and test data as command line arguments
 *  Output : Decision tree identified using train data and accuracy of decision tree for train and test data
 *  
 *  Example for windows - 
 *  C:\> java ID3/ID3 "D:\Machine Learning\Homework\HW1\Data\train.dat" "D:\Machine Learning\Homework\HW1\Data\test.dat"
